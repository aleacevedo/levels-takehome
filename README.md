Included are a few technical problems so we can get a sense of how you work, approach problems, and express ideas in code. To respect your time, we’ve tried to designed them to not take a ton of time. **Important: choose any two**. You can read through all three, and pick two to work on.

These are loosly based on what we'd do in a live interview, but since you'll have independent time to think about them (without as much of a time pressure), they are a bit longer. However, please optimize for how you might approach this on the job. Don’t worry about perfection. We primarily want to see how you structure and approach technical problems.

If you need anything clarified, please reach out (Andrew will be available via email). Please try to only spend roughly the time estimate (or less!) on each problem. We encourage you to read through the three problems ahead of time to ask any questions you have.

You can use any resources online, references, etc, and may install any packages (please specify them in `package.json`). We’ve provided sample stubs, but you can change _anything_ that’s provided.

This interview focuses on backend development. Each problem has its own `README.md` and should be easy to get started. You will need `npm` installed. If you have `nvm`, you can use the version we pre-defined with `nvm install && nvm use`. Then you can run `npm i`, then `npm run script`.
